You should find two files along with this README.txt: xml_interchange.py and an xml project file. As it is now, the xml file isn’t ready for import into FCP 7 or Premiere and you may or may not have the referenced media files downloaded either. Follow the steps below to get the latest project and media into either FCP 7 or Premiere Pro:

1. Move the folder that contains this file to wherever you’d like it to live. Keep in mind that this folder will be populated with media files which consume a lot of space. Perhaps you have an external hard drive you’d like to move this folder to.
2. For Windows users: You will need to download and install Python language to continue: https://www.python.org/download/
3. Open your command line terminal and execute the xml_interchange.py script (Mac users, drag the file from a Finder window into the terminal window and hit enter). This will quickly update file paths for your system and then download any project media that you don’t already have in the current folder (the one which xml_interchange.py script lives within). This script may take a very long time to execute as it’s downloading large media files. Wait until it is finished before moving on.
4. At this point, your xml project file has been updated and all of the media should be downloaded. Now, open either FCP 7 or Premiere Pro and import the xml file. When you’re ready to submit an edited sequence, just export an xml of it and send it to winston@curiousercreative.com
